<h5>How to Set up TURBOC3</h5>
<h6>Requirements:</h6>
<h7>* Working computer 
</h7>
<h6>Steps :</h6>
<h7>* Go to .......................................... and download TURBOC3 or TURBOC++ editor for windows
* Install TURBOC3 on your computer
* Open TURBOC3 
* Turboc3 is a Command lane based software hence once you enter you won't be able to see your cursor but a BLACK BLOCK sometimes it won't even support mouse hence use keyboard to navigate
* Notice that in each of the menu options above TURBOC3 (file,edit,etc...) there is one letter highlighted like "F" for file "E" for edit etc... Hold "ALT" key in keyboard and press that highlighted option to trigger menu(For example hold ALT and press F to open FILE menu)
* Now when you open FILE menu you can see many options like new file, open, save, save as, etc... To open each item you can see one highlited letter or one letter in a different color just press that corresponding key on the keyboard to access that item for example enter "n" to create new file....
* So after opening TURBOC3 step1: Press ALT+F     step2: Press n
* Now type the code in the files in this repository manually without missing any space or symbols (Manual typing is better as copy pasting is a bit tougher in TURBOC3) 
* Now we need to compile this code we made in order to convert it into a special file .To do this press ALT kry and F9 function key simultaneously
Now our file is compiled
* Now to run this file press CTRL key + F9
* Now a command prompt had opened and your code had started...
* Congrats you have successfully compiled and had run your code :>
If you had not got a command prompt or had got a bunch of errors feel free to comment on this file and I will try to help ya:)
* Follow the Instructions and do accordingly: : What you see now are all part of the code you have just typed into the editor
